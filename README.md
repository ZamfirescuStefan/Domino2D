# Simulation for a Domino 2D in OpenGl  

I made a simulation of a domino 2D game in OpenGl, using translations and rotations.
The project it's implemented in C++ language.

Here you can see a demo of the simulation:

**Nice touches:**

- the user can choose the number of dominos
  
- the table changes its dimensions depending on the number of dominos
  
- when a piece is moving, the color of it is changing

**Libraries used:**

- freeGlut
- glew
- glm

*This program was developed as a homework for the Computer Graphics at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, 2020-2021.*
